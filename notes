- Base class that has physics state and methods
- Subclass for each object
- Code voltage and field caused by each object
- Force and torque calculations for each shape
- F = ma
- Time step size
- Gravity
- Magnetic force
- Conductors (using iterative state)
- Pins / axles
- Simple collisions (wall collisions)
